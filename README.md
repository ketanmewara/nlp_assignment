## Requirements

1. Set Up Your Environment <br>
Install Required Libraries

2. Prepare the Dataset <br>
   Load your dataset (e.g., a CSV file or dataset from the datasets library). <br> 
   1. Data Preprocessing
   2. Remove URLs, mentions, hashtags, and special characters.
   3. Normalize text by lowercasing and tokenizing. 

Preprocess the dataset by tokenizing the text. This involves converting the text into input IDs and attention masks.

3. Load and Configure the Model <br> 
    1. Load the Pre-trained BERT Model
    2. Set Up Training Arguments

4. Train the Model
    1. Define Metrics for Evaluation
    2. Create a Trainer Instance
    3. Start Training

5. Evaluate the Model
6. Save the Fine-Tuned Model

## Requirements for Deployment
1. Compute Resources: Depending on the model size and traffic, choose appropriate compute resources such as CPUs, GPUs, or TPUs. Cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud.
2. Storage: Ensure sufficient storage for the model and its dependencies. (e.g., AWS S3).
3. Containerization: Package the model and its environment into a container using Docker. This ensures consistency across different deployment environments.
4. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
     1. Automation: Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment of model updates.
     2. Version Control: Use version control systems (e.g., Git) to manage model versions and track changes.

## Ways to Deploy the Model to Production
1. Set Up Server: Deploy the model on a local server using libraries like Flask or FastAPI.
2. Cloud Services: Utilize managed services such as AWS SageMaker, Google AI Platform, or Azure Machine Learning to deploy and manage the model.

## Metrics to Monitor After Deployment
1. Accuracy Metrics
    1. Model Accuracy: Track the modelâ€™s prediction accuracy over time to ensure it maintains performance.
    2. Precision, Recall, and F1 Score: Measure how well the model performs in different aspects, especially if the data distribution changes.
